# Route Optimizer App

A React Native application for field service route optimization with Google Maps integration.

## Features

- üó∫Ô∏è Google Maps integration with numbered markers
- üìç Customer location management with MEGA DATABASE
- üöö Route optimization for daily deliveries
- üì± Native performance on Android and iOS
- üîç Search and filter customers by day

## Architecture

Built with React Native CLI (not Expo) for maximum native module compatibility and performance.

### Key Components

- `GoogleMapsView`: Native Google Maps implementation
- `CustomerMarker`: Numbered markers with InfoWindows
- `DatabaseManager`: Singleton service for customer data
- `MapScreen`: Main interface with search and filtering

## Cloud Build Setup (GitHub Actions)

This project is configured for automatic cloud builds since Android SDK build tools require x86-64 architecture.

**Build Status**: Ready for cloud builds! üöÄ

### Setup GitHub Repository

1. Create a new repository on GitHub
2. Add your Google Maps API key to GitHub Secrets:
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions
   - Add `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` with your API key value
3. Push this code to trigger automatic builds

### Environment Setup

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Add your Google Maps API key to `.env`
3. The GitHub Actions workflow will handle the rest

## Step 1: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
bundle install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
bundle exec pod install
```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app ‚Äî you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

## Step 3: Modify your app

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's make changes!

Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and make some changes. When you save, your app will automatically update and reflect these changes ‚Äî¬†this is powered by [Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh).

When you want to forcefully reload, for example to reset the state of your app, you can perform a full reload:

- **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Dev Menu**, accessed via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ‚åò</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (macOS).
- **iOS**: Press <kbd>R</kbd> in iOS Simulator.

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
